#UMI Hardware
##Overview
This repository contains all hardware code for the initial UMI lightswitch prototype. UMI is an energy monitoring system that tracks usage within the power outlets and light switches of your home. The premier UMI product, the UMI Lightswitch, includes a small e-ink display that empowers you to take control of your electrical usage. 

The prototype for this product was created with an Arduino Mega, the RePaper E-Ink display, the CC3300 Arduino WiFi Shield, and an energy monitoring system developed in-house.
